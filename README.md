# Tick-oaT-Two

In this fun and enjoyable game, you can play with a friend or against an AI. 
While there is a strategy that allows the second player to win every time, the AI uses a variation of this strategy that still allows the first player to win.

To use this application, run
```gh repo clone https://github.com/just-another-guy-with-a-username/tic-oat-two```

More updates will come as I make more variations of tic-tac-toe.
