# Tick-oaT-Two

## The first one added!

In this fun and enjoyable game, you can play with a friend or against an AI. 
While there is a strategy that allows the second player to win every time, the AI uses a variation of this strategy that still allows the first player to win.

# Tic-Tac-Toe

## The original!

In this fun and enjoyable game, you can play with a friend or against an AI, but with simple rules that are immediately understood by the vast majority of people. 
While the first player can force win or draw every time, the AI operates in such a way that the player can win sometimes to make it more fun.

# Inverse Tic-Tac-Toe

## !lanigiro ehT

In this fun and enjoyable game, you can play with a friend or against an AI, but with simple rules that are immediately understood by the vast majority of people. 
While the second player can force win or draw every time, the AI only goes second half the time. That's right, this AI is actually unbeatable. Good luck!

# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

## "Spooky action, at a distance. . ."

In this complicated and confounding game, you place superposed x's and o's that sometimes entangle with other x's and o's, eventually leading to their collapse back into regulary positioned particles.
No AI for this one, have fun playing your friends!
